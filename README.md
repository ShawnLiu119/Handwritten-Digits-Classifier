# Handwritten-Digits-Classifier
Building A Handwritten Digits Classifier w/h Deep Neural Network

In this Project, I will:

explore why image classification is a hard task
observe the limitations of traditional machine learning models for image classification
train, test, and improve a few different deep neural networks for image classification
we'll build models that can classify handwritten digits. Before the year 2000, institutions like the United States Post Office used handwriting recognition software to read addresses, zip codes, and more.
